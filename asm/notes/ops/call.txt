# any info about the "call" operation will be put into this file #

call essentially does three important things:

    pushes instuction pointer (EIP) onto the stack,
    performs a jump operation to the specified function,
    and then with a combination of these two operations; allows the us to jump to somewhere else in the program, then jump back to where we were

    this also allows us to remove any hardcoded return values and can be called from anywhere in our code

this is very effective and useful for calling functions in more abstracted languages, particularly bi-compatability with c

an example of the call operation being used can be found in ../learned/callop.asm
